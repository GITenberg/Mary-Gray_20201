description: Mary's father, Walter Gray, was employed at a watchmaker's of repute.
  He spent all his working life with a magnifying glass in his eye, peering into the
  mechanism of watches, adjusting the delicate pivots and springs on which their lives
  moved. His occupation had perhaps encouraged in him a habit of introspection. Perhaps
  he found the human machine as worthy of interest as the works of watches and clocks.
  Anyhow, in his leisure moments, which were few, he would discuss curiously with
  Mary the hidden springs that kept the human machine in motion, the strange workings
  and convolutions of it. From the very early age when she began to be a comfort and
  a companion to her father, Mary had been accustomed to such speculations as would
  have written Walter Gray down a madman if he had shared them with the grown people
  about him rather than with a child. Mary was the child of his romance, of his first
  marriage, which had lasted barely a year.
